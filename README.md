# Assignment 11.1 - What drives the price of a car?

This analysis explores the pricing of used cars and comes up with the factors that are most important in determining the price of a used car. A large data set of used car prices along with various factors about the car has been analysed. The results of this analysis are as follows.

Used car prices increase exponentially as the age of the vehicle decreases, so newer vehicles are priced higher. Odometer readings do not have an impact in used car pricing nearly as much as the age of the car.

The features that heavily impact used car prices are:

Year of manufacture - the more recent the used car was built, the higher the price.
Condition of the car - vehicles in excellent and like-new conditions are priced higher. Vehicles listed as fair condition are priced lower.
The type of the vehicle - pickups, trucks, and convertible vehicles are priced higher, and sedans, mini-vans and hatchbacks have a negative effect on prices.
Type of fuel - Diesel vehicles get a higher used car price than gasoline vehicles, and even used electric vehicles are higher prices than gas-powered ones.
Size of the vehicle - full-size and mid-size vehicles command higher prices than compact ones.
Color - paint color does not have much impact on the price, although certain colors such as grey, black and white fetch higher prices.
Cars with missing title do not have as much value as cars with clean titles.
Rear-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive vehicles get higher prices than fore-wheel drive vehicles.
Manual transmission has a higher impact on prices than automatic transmission ones.
